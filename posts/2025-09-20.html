    <h1>Unlocking Free & Legal Stock Photos: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Finding high-quality images for your projects can be a challenge, especially when you're on a budget.  Fortunately, numerous websites offer free and legally accessible stock photos, eliminating the need for expensive subscriptions or risky copyright infringement.</p>

    <h2>Top Websites for Free Stock Photos</h2>

    <p>Several reputable websites provide a treasure trove of royalty-free images.  These sites often operate under Creative Commons licenses, allowing for commercial use with proper attribution (often just a link back to the source). Some popular choices include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unsplash:</strong> Known for its stunning, high-resolution photos contributed by talented photographers.</li>
        <li><strong>Pexels:</strong> Boasts a vast collection of easily searchable images, categorized for convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Pixabay:</strong> Offers a wide variety of images, illustrations, and videos, all completely free to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Gratisography:</strong> Features quirky and unique photos, perfect for adding a distinctive touch to your projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding Creative Commons Licenses</h2>

    <p>Many free stock photo websites utilize Creative Commons licenses.  These licenses specify the permitted uses of the images, often requiring attribution.  Always check the license details for each image before using it to ensure compliance.  Failing to adhere to the license terms can lead to legal issues.</p>

    <p>Remember to carefully review the license associated with each image before downloading and using it in your project. Proper attribution is crucial when using photos under Creative Commons licenses. By utilizing these fantastic resources, you can significantly enhance your projects without incurring unnecessary costs or legal risks.</p>
