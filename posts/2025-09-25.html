    <h1>5 Passive Income Ideas That Still Work in 2025</h1>

    <p>Looking for ways to boost your income without sacrificing your time?  Passive income streams, while requiring initial effort, can generate consistent revenue with minimal ongoing work.  Here are five ideas that remain effective in 2025:</p>

    <h2>1. Affiliate Marketing</h2>
    <p>Promote other companies' products or services on your website, blog, or social media.  Earn a commission for each sale generated through your unique affiliate link.  <b>Pros:</b> Relatively low startup costs, scalable potential. <b>Cons:</b> Requires building an audience,  commission rates can be low, success depends on marketing skills.</p>

    <h2>2. Creating and Selling Online Courses</h2>
    <p>Share your expertise by creating and selling online courses on platforms like Udemy, Teachable, or Thinkific.  <b>Pros:</b> High profit potential, once created, courses generate passive income. <b>Cons:</b> Requires significant upfront effort in course creation and marketing, competition can be fierce.</p>

    <h2>3. Print-on-Demand</h2>
    <p>Design and sell custom-printed products (t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, etc.) without holding any inventory.  Platforms like Printful and Printify handle printing and shipping.  <b>Pros:</b> Low risk, no inventory management. <b>Cons:</b> Profit margins can be lower due to platform fees, design skills are necessary.</p>

    <h2>4. Stock Photography/Videography</h2>
    <p>Sell your high-quality photos and videos on stock websites like Shutterstock, iStock, or Adobe Stock.  <b>Pros:</b>  Once uploaded, your content can generate income repeatedly. <b>Cons:</b> Requires strong photography/videography skills, competition is high, earning potential may be slow initially.</p>

    <h2>5. Rental Income (Real Estate or Digital Products)</h2>
    <p>Rent out physical properties (if you own them) or digital products like ebooks, software, or templates.  <b>Pros:</b> Consistent, predictable income stream. <b>Cons:</b>  Requires initial investment (for real estate), managing tenants or customers can be time-consuming (though less so with digital products).</p>

    <p>Remember that building a successful passive income stream takes time and effort.  Consistency and strategic planning are key to achieving your financial goals.  Explore these ideas and choose the one that best aligns with your skills and resources.</p>
