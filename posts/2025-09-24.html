    <h1>5 Passive Income Ideas That Still Work in 2025</h1>

    <p>Looking for ways to boost your income without sacrificing your time?  Passive income streams offer the enticing promise of earning money while you sleep.  While "passive" often implies minimal effort,  successful passive income requires initial investment and ongoing maintenance. Here are five ideas still generating revenue in 2025:</p>

    <h2>1. Affiliate Marketing</h2>
    <p>Promote other companies' products or services on your website, blog, or social media and earn a commission on each sale.  <b>Pros:</b> Relatively low startup costs, scalable potential.  <b>Cons:</b> Requires building an audience, commissions can be low, reliant on other businesses' success.</p>

    <h2>2. Creating and Selling Online Courses</h2>
    <p>Share your expertise by creating and selling online courses through platforms like Udemy or Teachable. <b>Pros:</b> High profit margins, recurring revenue potential. <b>Cons:</b> Requires significant upfront work in course creation and marketing, competition is fierce.</p>

    <h2>3. Print-on-Demand</h2>
    <p>Design and sell custom-printed products (t-shirts, mugs, etc.) without holding inventory.  Platforms like Printful handle production and shipping. <b>Pros:</b> Low risk, no inventory management. <b>Cons:</b> Profit margins can be smaller, reliant on design appeal and marketing efforts.</p>

    <h2>4. Investing in Dividend-Paying Stocks</h2>
    <p>Invest in companies that regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders. <b>Pros:</b> Relatively passive income stream, potential for long-term growth. <b>Cons:</b> Requires initial capital investment, returns are not guaranteed, market fluctuations can impact income.</p>

    <h2>5. Rental Income (Real Estate or Digital Products)</h2>
    <p>Rent out physical property (apartment, house) or digital products (eBooks, software, templates).  <b>Pros:</b>  Potential for consistent monthly income.  <b>Cons:</b> Requires significant initial investment (real estate) or ongoing maintenance (digital products), managing tenants or customers can be time-consuming.</p>

    <p>Remember, success with any passive income stream requires dedication, planning, and consistent effort. While these methods can generate significant income, they aren't truly "passive" in the sense of requiring zero effort.  However, with the right approach, they can significantly improve your financial situation.</p>
